a Python program that will play the "A and B" game with a user. The game works like this:  
One randomly generates a 4-digit number and asks the user to guess this 4-digit number. For every digit that the user guesses correctly in the correct place, the user gets an “A”.  For every digit the user guesses correctly in the wrong place, the user gets a “B”. Every time the user makes a guess, tell them how many “As” and “Bs” the user gets. The process continues until the user guesses the correct 4-digit number and the game is over. During the process, keep track of the number of guesses the user makes throughout the game and tell the user at the end.
